The enviroment we are working locally, inside of anaconda is called  dashenv1
the requierements.txt file, has the library versions we are using.

This projects idea is to create custom dash dashboard, that allow interactive barplots, histograms and scatterplots.
As dash requires the use of pyplot code, we have basic pyplot graphs examples in the pyplot basics folder.

plotly version 2.7 is required, because afterwards there is a bug regarding the color agrgument when using markers.
